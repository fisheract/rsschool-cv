#### Project manager/ IT integration manager
Planning, control, build integration architecture, testing alpha version and closing after final tests. Work with project documentation, writing manuals, faq and docs for products. Organizing outsource developers workflow.

Currently Iâ€™m supporting 10 integration systems as technical helpdesk manager. These integration systems consist from: selling, pricing, transport logistics and reports functionality.
Technical documentation for building these systems were written by me according to business needs mostly using API. Testing these systems manually and trying to write automated functional tests but no one needs them, so keep doing it in free time.

Finished automatic report generating script, for collecting data for regions and pushing it to PowerBI system. Script was written by python(requests, Pandas, Beautifulsoup4, json)
